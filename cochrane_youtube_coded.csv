According to the CDC layered prevention strategies ‚Äî like staying up to date on vaccines and wearing masks ‚Äî can help prevent severe illness and reduce the potential for strain on the healthcare system. Wear a mask with the best fit, protection, and comfort for you. If you are in an area with a high COVID-19 Community Level and are ages 2 or older, wear a well-fitting mask indoors in public. If you are sick and need to be around others, or are caring for someone who has COVID-19, wear a mask. If you are at increased risk for severe illness, or live with or spend time with someone at higher risk, speak to your healthcare provider about wearing a mask at medium COVID-19 Community Levels.""

ActionGamesNow,3KAgj-LNRH8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KAgj-LNRH8,2023-02-10T05:45:10Z,"A major new study indicates that masks don't stop COVID Apologize, mandates.","The COVID pandemic is now in the past. We know a lot about it, like how well our countermeasures worked because of studies. Dozens of scientists from all over the world put together a huge metastudy of our efforts to fight COVID and the flu, and the results were published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The authors looked at 78 different studies to see how effective different measures were, like masking, moving away, screening, quarantining, and washing hands. How did these actions stop the flu, COVID, and other viruses from spreading? Different kinds of studies were included. They talked about times when transmission was high and times when it was low. They talked about both rich and poor countries, schools in the suburbs and schools in the city, hospitals and villages. The most important thing was what they both had: All of the studies were either randomised controlled trials or cluster-RCTs. These are the best kind of studies because they have the best chance of not being messed up by other things. Non-randomized, non-controlled trials, like observational studies, can be messed up if, for example, more people start wearing masks at times or places where the rate of spread is already high, or if people who wear masks also wash their hands more often. So, what did the research say? First of all, washing your hands helped stop the spread of these illnesses. That shouldn't be a surprise. But here's what surprised me the most: ""Wearing masks in public probably doesn't change the outcome of influenza-like illnesses or COVID-19-like illnesses much, if at all."" In other words, masks didn't do much, if anything at all. It's possible that a community could slow the spread of a disease if everyone wore high-quality, well-fitted masks like N-95s or respirators, but there's no proof that it does. Think back to late 2020 or early 2022, when mayors, governors, school districts, and even the U.S. Department of Transportation and Joe Biden made people, especially children, wear masks even though the spread of the virus was very low. When public health workers told us to wear masks early on, they were just being safe. But as time went on, officials switched from asking people to making them wear masks, even though it was becoming less clear that masks worked. They didn't just give orders, though. They called anyone who didn't follow their orders ""selfish grandma-killers."" The mayors and county executives who made people wear masks knew that they didn't work because they didn't wear them themselves in the same situations where they were making people wear them. What happened in the past really happened. The people who wanted to make masks mandatory in 2020 had a good reason. The people in charge in 2023 don't. Today, they should all come clean and explain why they did the things they did wrong. If the people who made the mask rule don't explain where they went wrong, they lose any authority and credibility they still have.",News & Politics,67,0,misleading,

Also, ‚ÄúThere were no clear differences between the use of medical/surgical masks compared with N95/P2 respirators in healthcare workers when used in routine care to reduce respiratory viral infection‚Äù.

Text Screen News,zZTbvFDC3Hg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZTbvFDC3Hg,2023-02-15T20:58:49Z,Twitter erupts after CDC Director Walensky tells Congress masking guidance 'doesn't really change ..,"Twitter erupts after CDC Director Walensky tells Congress masking guidance 'doesn't really change with time' A Congressional hearing sent Twitter into a tailspin after Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky admitted that the public health agency's mask guidance for children ""doesn't really change with time."" Sitting before the House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing, Walensky told lawmakers on Feb. 8 that the CDC will continue to recommend masks in schools in communities where COVID-19 levels are high. Claiming that the CDC is the only national or international agency that recommends masking for 2-year-old children, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., asked Walensky to explain the process and timeline by which the CDC uses evidence to update, modify or withdraw current guidance. A newly released review published by the Cochrane Library researched 78 controlled trials to determine whether various mitigation strategies, such as masking or handwashing, curbed the spread of COVID-19. The review found that mask-wearing in the community probably makes ""little or no difference."" Walensky said the study only includes randomized clinical trials that researched other respiratory viruses in addition to COVID-19. She noted that since COVID-19 can spread before symptoms occur, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of some of the study's conclusions. ""One of the limitations in that study was clearly stated that people were not actually engaged in the intervention ‚Äî so you actually have to wear the mask for it to work,"" she said. As Walensky continued to speak, Rodgers interjected, grabbed her podium mic, and asked why kids are still masked to this day. The CDC chief said that the masking guidance depends on the virus's community levels and said it was fortunate that most communities are in the low or moderate range of spread, where masking is not recommended. ""Our masking guidance doesn't really change with time ‚Äî what it changes with is disease,"" she said. ""So, when there is a lot of diseases in the community, we recommend that those communities and those schools mask. When there's less disease in the community, we recommend that those masks can come off."" Walensky's response about masking did not go over well with some prominent Twitter users, who claimed that the CDC was not following the most up-to-date science. ""So, still relying on the bogus study co-authored by not-a-doctor Ferrer's staff and her not-a-doctor daughter?"" Red State Managing Editor Jennifer Van Laar tweeted. She then linked to a story on Red State's website that detailed a study finding COVID mitigation efforts in schools, including forced masking, were highly effective tools in stopping the spread of the virus. The study, used by the CDC and numerous states as the basis for school mask mandates, was authored by Los Angeles County officials, including Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer's daughter, who does not have a doctorate. University of Toronto Assistant Professor J.D. Haltigan called Walensky ""innumerate"" and her comments ""utterly ridiculous."" ""'Follow the science' except when it limits the overreach of your power,"" author and clinical psychologist Dr. Jordan B. Peterson tweeted. WSB Radio legal analyst and Townhall columnist Philip Holloway wrote, ""After all the @CDCgov mask nagging, mandating, coercing and ordering, badgering and shaming, I guess expecting them to follow real science and reverse course on masks is too much to expect. Instead @CDCDirector shows her sunk cost bias and digs her heels in.""",News & Politics,94,2,,

Wet cupping, in particular, is used for acne because it can remove heat and stagnation. It has been theorized that wet cupping has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, which may be a reason it can be helpful for some skin conditions.[1] There are a number of small studies and reports for wet cupping alone or in combination with other therapies that have been successful in treating acne, [1,5-8] particularly for inflammatory and cystic acne. In TCM, it is very common to combine cupping with other modalities such as acupuncture or herbal medicine. A meta-analysis of wet cupping concluded that cupping alone or in combination with herbal interventions is more effective than herbal interventions alone.[8] Cupping combined with acupuncture was found to have a trend toward being more effective than acupuncture alone.[8] For example, in a small, uncontrolled trial of wet cupping combined with an herbal face mask, the majority of patients saw significant improvement.[9] Another study that examined wet cupping found that 10 of 11 people with acne had improvement in their symptoms.[1] In these patients, cupping also significantly reduced serum IgE and IL-2 levels and significantly increased serum C3 levels.[1] These studies show the promising effects of cupping as an adjunctive treatment for acne, though further studies are needed. Where is Cupping Done for Acne? Cups are placed on different parts of the body for different conditions. For example, with chest congestion, the cups are often placed on the upper part of the chest, but for back pain, they would be done on the back. When treating inflammatory conditions, such as acne, the goal is to remove heat and toxins. This is generally done through cupping on the back. Even if the acne is on the face or chest, it is most often done on the back. How Does Cupping Work? According to Chinese medicine, cupping helps to stimulate the circulation of qi and blood and remove heat toxins from the body. We don‚Äôt know everything about how cupping works yet, but some researchers are starting to piece it together. Wet cupping has been shown to have an antioxidant effect,[5] and may also have an anti-inflammatory effect.[1] Is Cupping Safe for Acne? Cupping is mostly safe for treating acne. Cupping will leave bruises on the areas around the cups. Anemia has been reported as a side effect from wet cupping so caution should be taken not to treat excessively. [1] Practical Tips Cupping has been used in cultures throughout the world to stimulate the circulation of qi and blood and remove toxins from the body. Cupping appears to have systemic antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects and may be considered as an adjunctive treatment for acne. * This Website is for general skin beauty, wellness, and health information only.

Jennifer shares her story of beginning to question the government's COVID policies and how Levi's claimed she was speaking for the company. This resulted in Levi's severing ties with Jennifer, arguing that her views didn't align with the company's. Now we're seeing more and more data emerge that proves Jennifer was right ‚Äì COVID lockdowns were harmful for multiple reasons, and the benefits did not outweigh the negatives. We talk politics in the corporate world (and corporate America's response to COVID), and we look at two studies, one that shows masks aren't as effective as we were told all along and one that shows COVID infection before the Omicron variant was even more effective for immunity than the vaccination. #news #politics #covid19 --- Timecodes: (00:00) Intro (01:53) Interview with Jennifer begins / Jennifer's previous politics (05:58) Tribalism / allegiance to the party (18:59) The emotional side (26:16) Do you feel like you were a part of corporate leftism?

New Research Reveals Surprising Results #shortnews,"Are Face Masks Really Effective Against Viruses? New Research Reveals Surprising Results #shortnews @pakistanwink In this video, we explore the latest Cochrane Review on the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of respiratory infections like COVID-19 and influenza. Despite the widespread use of masks during the pandemic, the review found that using a surgical or medical mask ""probably makes little or no difference"" in preventing infections brought on by viruses like influenza or COVID. However, the findings are not entirely conclusive, as some of the studies examined were conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic and many people didn't consistently wear their masks. The video also discusses the current mask policies in different parts of the world, including Hong Kong, where wearing a mask in public is mandatory. Although the Cochrane Review may seem discouraging, health professionals still recommend that people wear masks, especially those who are at high risk. This video provides a balanced perspective on the use of face masks and highlights the importance of taking action to stop the spread of respiratory infections, even if there is only a small benefit.

[KBS 9F current affairs office],"9F current affairs office Airdate : 2023.02.15 Over the past three years, our society has experienced a contradictory situation in which people take off their masks when sitting at restaurants and wear masks when they go to pay. And although the mandatory indoor mask policy was abolished not long ago, many people still wear masks habitually. Was the mask really effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19? The 9th-floor current affairs Office ""Mask Contradictory Society"" presents the argument and grounds for distinguishing the effect of masks from the effect of mask mandatory policies, and reports the case of Sweden, which maintained the no-mask policy throughout the pandemic. It also raises concerns that masks can adversely affect teenagers and infants. Furthermore, The 9th-floor current affairs Office reports on what we should discuss now in case another pandemic era comes in the future.

The study conducted by the British non-profit Cochrane was based on 78 randomized controlled trials in multiple countries. Researchers say the results track what has been largely observed in the US. States with mask mandates fared no better against COVID than those without. Psychiatrist and author of ""The New Abnormal: Rise of the Biomedical Security State,"" Dr. Aaron Kheriaty, joins to share his thoughts on these findings. A separate study recently published in the medical journal, The Lancet, found that immunity acquired from having COVID is on par with the immunity that's provided through 2 doses of an mRNA vaccine. Dr. Kheriaty argued for natural immunity 2 years ago and lost his job for it. He tells us his reaction to this study. Dr. Kheriaty explains whether there will be consequences similar to what he faced for doctors or others choosing to follow the Lancet study. Over the weekend, another ""COVID conspiracy theory"" was lent some credence with the Energy Department now saying a lab leak was the most likely origin of the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Kheriaty discusses why he thinks all of these findings are just being released now. EWTN News Nightly provides the latest news and analysis from a Catholic perspective.

Cochrane is a global network of independent researchers who determine the efficacy of medical interventions. We explain the process that Cochrane goes through to determine the effectiveness of medical interventions and discuss the speaker's initial skepticism about masks. We then delve into the Cochrane study, which found that there is uncertainty about whether wearing masks or respirators can slow the spread of respiratory viruses. The study reviewed several types of masks, including N95 and surgical masks, and found little to no difference in preventing respiratory illnesses. We also highlight the limitations of the study, including poor study design and insufficiently powered studies. The video concludes by acknowledging that the quality of evidence reviewed only supports moderate certainty in the conclusions drawn about wearing masks. Overall, this video provides an informative and insightful analysis of the effectiveness of masks in preventing respiratory viruses.",Education,149,9,nuanced_accurate,

Newsom,"Government Censorship, Disinformation, and Scientific Consensus ‚Äì A Litigation Update on Missouri v. Biden & Hoeg v. Newsom How are we to understand scientific consensus? Who is authorized to speak on behalf of doctors and scientists as a whole, and how do those who present themselves as messengers of the majority reach their material findings? In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, these questions, and others like them, have important consequences for the future of American science and medicine. The complaint in Missouri v. Biden arises from the controversy surrounding the Great Barrington Declaration, a declaration written in October 2020 and authored by renowned epidemiologists criticizing contemporary, aggressive COVID-19 policies. Plaintiffs allege that the federal government coerced social media companies to silence opposing viewpoints under the pretense of halting ‚Äúdisinformation‚Äù and ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù thereby violating the First Amendment. Hoeg v. Newsom is born of similar allegations at the state level. On September 30, 2022, the California State Legislature passed Assembly Bill No. 2098 that purports to rein in ‚Äúdisinformation‚Äù and ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù about the COVID-19 virus and vaccines. The Bill states that ‚ÄúIt shall constitute unprofessional conduct for a physician and surgeon to disseminate misinformation or disinformation related to COVID-19, including false or misleading information regarding the nature and risks of the virus, its prevention and treatment; and the development, safety, and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.‚Äù Plaintiffs ‚Äì all physicians licensed by the Medical Board of California ‚Äì allege that the Bill violates their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights by interfering with their ability to freely communicate to patients and dissent from mainstream viewpoints in their professional capacity as trained doctors. Observers have noted that achieving scientific consensus on an emergent and politicized disease is very difficult. For example, the purported scientific consensus on masks, lockdowns, natural immunity, and various other COVID-related matters has remained in flux over the past three years. Some argue that government attempts to stifle debate are concerning and illustrate the purpose of the First Amendment.

Unbiased Science,HNcMBtnFxmc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNcMBtnFxmc,2023-03-10T00:34:31Z,Let's discuss the recent Cochrane Review on effectiveness of masks vs. SARS-CoV-2 #covid19 #masks,"A recent Cochrane Review is being used as evidence that masks are not effective at preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 but there are several limitations to the study. This is a meta-analysis which is a study design that combines data from multiple studies and re-analyzes them in an attempt to increase sample size and statistical power. However, the quality of the meta-analysis hinges upon both the quality of the studies being included, as well as their comparability. If you combine studies that are dissimilar in meaningful ways, you are essentially comparing apples to oranges. The studies included (the majority of which were conducted prior to COVID-19) investigates different mask types which works in very different ways. Surgical masks prevent splatter of spit and viral particles but don‚Äôt do a very good job of protecting the WEARER since they are loose-fitting and don‚Äôt filter particles very well. N95 respirators on the other hand, are tight-fitting and are designed to filter particles‚Äî they have been well-established to be highly effective at protecting the wearer from becoming infected and they prevent an infected wearer from spreading their germs to other people. However, most of the studies included in this review only assessed the former scenario. (The researchers asked people to wear masks and then tested to see if those people became infected. This significantly underestimates the utility of masks. especially N95s.) Another major limitation is that the studies did not assess actual adherence to mask-wearing, they assessed masking advice; of course, masks are only effective when they are worn. In fact, the authors of the review acknowledged that compliance with masking advice was poor. The studies were conducted in different settings‚Äî some were community settings while others were healthcare settings. Risk of transmission is far higher in healthcare settings where there‚Äôs a higher concentration of sick people. There are dozens of very credible studies that have shown, without question, that‚Äî when worn properly‚Äî masks, particularly N95s or similar, are extremely effective at preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Soares-Weiser also said, though, that one of the lead authors of the review even more seriously misinterpreted its finding on masks by saying in an interview that it proved ‚Äúthere is just no evidence that they make any difference.‚Äù In fact, Soares-Weiser said, ‚Äúthat statement is not an accurate representation of what the review found.‚Äù Cochrane reviews are often referred to as gold standard evidence in medicine because they aggregate results from many randomized trials to reach an overall conclusion ‚Äî a great method for evaluating drugs, for example, which often are subjected to rigorous but small trials. Combining their results can lead to more confident conclusions. Masks and mask mandates have been a hot controversy during the pandemic. The flawed summary ‚Äî and further misinterpretation of it ‚Äî set off a debate between those who said the study showed there was no basis for relying on masks or mask mandates and those who said it did nothing to diminish the need for them. Michael D. Brown, a doctor and academic who serves on the Cochrane editorial board and made the final decision on the review, told me the review couldn‚Äôt arrive at a firm conclusion because there weren‚Äôt enough high-quality randomized trials with high rates of mask adherence. While the review assessed 78 studies, only 10 of those focused on what happens when people wear masks versus when they don‚Äôt, and a further five looked at how effective different types of masks were at blocking transmission, usually for health care workers. The remainder involved other measures aimed at lowering transmission, like hand washing or disinfection, while a few studies also considered masks in combination with other measures. Of those 10 studies that looked at masking, the two done since the start of the Covid pandemic both found that masks helped.The calculations the review used to reach a conclusion were dominated by prepandemic studies that were not very informative about how well masks blocked the transmission of respiratory viruses. For example, in one study of hajj pilgrims in Mecca, only 24.7 percent of those assigned to wear masks reported using one daily, but not all the time (while 14.3 percent in the no-mask group wore one anyway).",News & Politics,4498,10,misleading,

Trussell argues that masks are largely useless and that their widespread adoption has been driven more by fear and politics than by science. Rogan, on the other hand, takes a more measured view, acknowledging that masks may not be perfect but that they can still play an important role in mitigating the spread of the virus. Throughout the conversation, the two friends explore the complex issues surrounding mask use, from the scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness to the social and political factors driving their adoption. They also delve into the psychological effects of the pandemic, from the fear and anxiety it has caused to the sense of community and solidarity that has emerged in response. Whether you're a skeptic or a believer in the efficacy of face masks, this video offers a thought-provoking look at the ongoing debate surrounding their use.
